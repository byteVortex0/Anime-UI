Anime-UI is a Flutter project created as a UI experiment focusing on designing an engaging anime-themed interface. The project currently implements several UI components and layouts without connecting to any domain logic or backend functionality.

## Features

- Custom UI screens with anime-inspired design  
- Use of `ListView` for dynamic content display  
- `FilterChip` widgets for interactive filtering  
- `Positioned` widgets for precise layout control  
- Bottom navigation for screen switching  
- Integration of `flutter_screenutil` for responsive layouts  
- Custom fonts using `google_fonts`

> ⚠️ Note: The project includes a Clean Architecture folder structure, but the domain and use case files are currently empty. This is meant for future development.
